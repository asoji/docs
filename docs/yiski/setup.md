# Yiski Bot Setup

This is a small guide on setting up Yiski.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Pip [because for some reason, sometimes Python just doesn't install pip.]
- A functioning computer
    - ideally have a brain too

## Install
1. Go to https://github.com/asoji/Yiski
2. Download a ZIP of Yiski and extract it, or `git clone https://github.com/asoji/Yiski.git Yiski` and go to where you `git clone`'d it
3. Using a terminal, `cd` into your Yiski folder and run `pip install .` and soon, it should start installing the dependencies for Yiski
4. After it's done, copy your `config.example.toml` and rename it to `config.toml`
    - Refer to https://docs.asoji.dev/docs/yiski/config now, come back when you're done.
5. After your config is all set up, use your terminal and run `py mainDiscord.py` or `py mainRevolt.py`, depending on which version of the bot you want to run.
    - You can run both at the same time, it shouldn't cause any conflicts.
6. You're all done now! If you want to shut off the bot, just CTRL + C in the terminal or run `yk!stop`

## Uninstalling the bot

1. just nuke your yiski folder **lol**.
